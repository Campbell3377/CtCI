# CtCI
Notes for Cracking the Coding Interview

# Chapter I. The Interview Process

- Usually the first stage will be a screening interview, 1 or 2 before being brought on-site
- In an on-site interview round, there will usually be 4-6 in-person interviews
    - One will usually be a less formal lunch interview to gather info about the company culture, the rest will be mostly technical including coding and algorithm questions
- Afterwards a recruiter should follow up to discuss your performance, if you wait a week you should reach out; not responding is not an indication of rejection
- The Interview Process
1. 1+ Years (before Interview)
    1. Build Projects outside of school / work
    2. Expand Network
    3. Build website / Portfolio
    4. Students: Find internships / Large school projects
    5. Professionals: Focus on “meaty” projects
2. 3-12 Months
    1. Continue to work on projects
    2. Create draft of resume and send out for review
    3. Make list of preferred companies
    4. Read intro sections of CtCI
    5. Begin practicing interview questions using Java or C++
    6. Form mock interview group with friends to interview each other
3. 1-3 Months
    1. Do mini-projects to solidify understanding of key concepts
    2. Do several mock interviews
    3. Continue to practice interview questions
    4. Create list to track mistakes you’ve made solving problems
4. 4 Weeks
    1. Create Interview Prep Grid
    2. Review / Update Resume
    3. Re-read intro to CtCI - especially Tech & Behavioral section
    4. Do another mock interview
    5. Continue to practice questions, writing code on paper
5. 1 Week
    1. On-site interview
    2. Phone interview
    3. Do a mock final interview
    4. Rehearse stories from the interview prep grid
    5. Re-read 5 Algorithm Approaches
    6. Continue to practice interview questions
    7. Review list of mistakes
6. Day Before
    1. Rehearse each story from interview prep grid once
    2. On-site interview: Print 10 copies of resume
    3. Continue to practice & review your list of mistakes
    4. Re-read 5 algorithms approaches
    5. Review Powers of 2 list. Print list if a phone screen
7. Day Of
    1. Wake up in plenty of time to eat a good breakfast
    2. Be confident (not cocky)
8. After
    1. Write thank you note to recruiter
    2. If you don’t hear back from recruiter, check in after one week
    3. If no offer, ask when you can re-apply

- Candidates are evaluated on four aspects:
    - Prior Experience, Culture Fit, Coding Skills, and Analytical Ability
    - Its alright to make mistakes, show your process and do not show any red-flags like getting frustrated or defensive

### Top 10 Mistakes

1. Practicing On A Computer
    - Use a compiler only to verify your solutions after you’ve written and hand-tested your code
2. Not Rehearsing Behavioral Questions
    - Look over your projects and positions and rehearse your key stories
3. Not doing a mock interview
    - If you’re preparing for a big speech, you’d be crazy to only practice silently in your head
4. Trying to memorize sections
    - The key is to develop strategies to approach new problems
5. Not solving problems out loud
    - Practice talking through problems as this is key to showing the interviewer your process
6. Rushing
    - Go through problems slowly and methodically. You’ll finish with less mistakes in less time
7. Sloppy Coding
    - Break code into sub-routines and design data structures to link appropriate data
8. Not Testing
    - When finished writing code, walk through the code to test it, or on more complicated problems test while writing it
9. Fixing Mistakes Carelessly
    - Think carefully about what your code is doing when it is not behaving as you expected
10. Giving Up
    - Don’t give up when faced with a tough question, give it your best and don’t worry about making mistakes. Mistakes are expected on more difficult questions

### Frequently Asked Questions

Should I tell my interviewer if I know a question? - Yes

1. Shows Integrity and honesty
2. The question might have changed, you don’t want to risk repeating the wrong answer
3. If you get it too easily or pretend to struggle, it may come off in the wrong way

What language should I use? 

- Recommends Java or C/C++\

# Chapter II. Behind The Scenes

### The Microsoft Interview

- Typical interview starts with a short interview with a recruiter who is usually there to prep you with a sample question, not too technical. Be nice, your recruiter can be your biggest advocate.
- During the day you’ll do 4 or 5 interviews, often with two different teams.
- Definitely Prepare: “Why do you want to work for Microsoft?”
    - In this question, Microsoft wants to see that you’re passionate about technology.
    - A great answer might be: “I’ve been using Microsoft software as long as I can remember and I’m really impressed at how Microsoft manages to create a product that is universally excellent. For example, I’ve been using Visual Studio recently to learn game programming, and it’s APIs are excellent.”
- What’s Unique: You’ll only reach the hiring manager if you’ve done well, so if you do, that’s a good sign

### The Amazon Interview

- Amazon’s recruiting process typically begins with two phone screens in which a candidate interviews with a specific team
- The engineer who interviews you will usually ask you to write simple code via a shared document editor, such as Collab Edit.
- They will often ask a broad set of questions to explore what areas of technology you’re familiar with
- Next, you fly to Seattle for four or five interviews with one or two teams that have selected you based on your resume and phone interviews
- You will have to code on a whiteboard, and some interviewers will stress other skills.
- The “bar raiser” interviewer is charged with keeping the interview bar high. This interview will be significantly more difficult
- Definitely Prepare: Amazon is a web-based company, and that means they care about scale. Make sure you prepare for scalability questions.
    - You don’t need a background in distributed systems to answer these questions, see the Scalability and Memory Limits chapter for sample questions
- Additionally, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object-oriented design. Check out the Object-Oriented Design chapter for sample questions and suggestions.
- What’s Unique: The bar raiser is brought in from a different team, you need to impress both this person and the hiring manager.

### The Google Interview

- A Google engineer performs the first phone screen, so expect tough technical questions, which may involve coding
- On your on-site interview, you’ll interview with 4-6 people, one of whom will be a lunch interviewer which is less formal and the feedback is not submitted, so the lunch interview is a great opportunity to ask honest questions
- Interviewers are not given specific focuses or structure so they can conduct the interview however they like
- Written feedback is submitted to a hiring committee (HC) or engineers and managers. Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding, Experience, and Communication) giving an overally score from 1.0-4.0
- To extend an offer, the HC prefers to see an “enthusiastic endorser”. In other words, a packet with scores of 3.6, 3.1, 3.1, and 2.6 is better than all 3.1’s
- Definitely Prepare: Google is a web-based company, and that means they care about scale. Make sure you prepare for scalability questions.
    - Additionally many interviewers will ask questions involving Bit Manipulation, so you are advised to brush up on these topics as well
- What’s Different: Your interviewers do not make the hiring decision, but rather their feedback is passed to the Hiring Committee.
