# CtCI
Notes for Cracking the Coding Interview

# Chapter I. The Interview Process

- Usually the first stage will be a screening interview, 1 or 2 before being brought on-site
- In an on-site interview round, there will usually be 4-6 in-person interviews
    - One will usually be a less formal lunch interview to gather info about the company culture, the rest will be mostly technical including coding and algorithm questions
- Afterwards a recruiter should follow up to discuss your performance, if you wait a week you should reach out; not responding is not an indication of rejection
- The Interview Process
1. 1+ Years (before Interview)
    1. Build Projects outside of school / work
    2. Expand Network
    3. Build website / Portfolio
    4. Students: Find internships / Large school projects
    5. Professionals: Focus on “meaty” projects
2. 3-12 Months
    1. Continue to work on projects
    2. Create draft of resume and send out for review
    3. Make list of preferred companies
    4. Read intro sections of CtCI
    5. Begin practicing interview questions using Java or C++
    6. Form mock interview group with friends to interview each other
3. 1-3 Months
    1. Do mini-projects to solidify understanding of key concepts
    2. Do several mock interviews
    3. Continue to practice interview questions
    4. Create list to track mistakes you’ve made solving problems
4. 4 Weeks
    1. Create Interview Prep Grid
    2. Review / Update Resume
    3. Re-read intro to CtCI - especially Tech & Behavioral section
    4. Do another mock interview
    5. Continue to practice questions, writing code on paper
5. 1 Week
    1. On-site interview
    2. Phone interview
    3. Do a mock final interview
    4. Rehearse stories from the interview prep grid
    5. Re-read 5 Algorithm Approaches
    6. Continue to practice interview questions
    7. Review list of mistakes
6. Day Before
    1. Rehearse each story from interview prep grid once
    2. On-site interview: Print 10 copies of resume
    3. Continue to practice & review your list of mistakes
    4. Re-read 5 algorithms approaches
    5. Review Powers of 2 list. Print list if a phone screen
7. Day Of
    1. Wake up in plenty of time to eat a good breakfast
    2. Be confident (not cocky)
8. After
    1. Write thank you note to recruiter
    2. If you don’t hear back from recruiter, check in after one week
    3. If no offer, ask when you can re-apply

- Candidates are evaluated on four aspects:
    - Prior Experience, Culture Fit, Coding Skills, and Analytical Ability
    - Its alright to make mistakes, show your process and do not show any red-flags like getting frustrated or defensive

### Top 10 Mistakes

1. Practicing On A Computer
    - Use a compiler only to verify your solutions after you’ve written and hand-tested your code
2. Not Rehearsing Behavioral Questions
    - Look over your projects and positions and rehearse your key stories
3. Not doing a mock interview
    - If you’re preparing for a big speech, you’d be crazy to only practice silently in your head
4. Trying to memorize sections
    - The key is to develop strategies to approach new problems
5. Not solving problems out loud
    - Practice talking through problems as this is key to showing the interviewer your process
6. Rushing
    - Go through problems slowly and methodically. You’ll finish with less mistakes in less time
7. Sloppy Coding
    - Break code into sub-routines and design data structures to link appropriate data
8. Not Testing
    - When finished writing code, walk through the code to test it, or on more complicated problems test while writing it
9. Fixing Mistakes Carelessly
    - Think carefully about what your code is doing when it is not behaving as you expected
10. Giving Up
    - Don’t give up when faced with a tough question, give it your best and don’t worry about making mistakes. Mistakes are expected on more difficult questions

### Frequently Asked Questions
